# Pragyan_rover
The performance measure evaluates how well the agent (in this case, the Python-based decision system for the Pragyan Rover) performs its task of making the correct decision (c0 or c1). The system should:
• Accuracy: Make the correct decision (c0 or c1) based on the provided decision tree logic.
•Efficiency: Perform the decision-making process efficiently without unnecessary steps or delays.
• User Interaction: Prompt the user with clear instructions and take valid inputs for the decision-making process.
• Error Handling: Handle invalid or incorrect inputs gracefully by repeatedly asking for valid input (i.e., ensuring that only "true" or "false" responses are accepted).
Thus, the performance measure in this case is:
• Correctness of decision (c0 or c1) based on the given inputs.
• Efficiency in completing the task promptly.
• User-friendliness and handling errors properly.
